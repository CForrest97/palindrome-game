> In the game a user can enter their name and a word. If the word is a palindrome then a high score should be recorded, the score being the length of the string. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. E.g. “bob”, “a man a plan a canal panama”. It is up to you what are considered valid characters.
